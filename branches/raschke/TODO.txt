Image redesign/cleanup TO DO:

* Actual handling of multi-area images, even if no format available
* Load and store min/max from/to files, allow overwriting
* Geo data parser/writer for comments
  - Comments are prepended with 'comment' at libpfm level; this does not bode well!
* Reorganize the directories in ga_image
* Merger with rest of project
* Use Size and LargeSize types for image dimensions
* Many assertions -> Exceptions
