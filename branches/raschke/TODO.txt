Image redesign/cleanup TO DO:

* Actual handling of multi-area images, even if no format available
* Geo data parser/writer for comments
  - Comments are prepended with 'comment' at libpfm level; this does not bode well!
* Reorganize the directories in ga_image
* Try to simplify the algorithm call -> template algorithm call translation
* Merger with rest of project
* Use Size and LargeSize types for image dimensions
* Many assertions -> Exceptions
* Documentation
* ...
* PROFIT!
