Image redesign/cleanup TO DO:

* Actual handling of multi-area images, even if no format available
* Documentation
* Oh my gosh, can those file headers not leave altogether?
* Windows port
* Geo data parser/writer for comments
  - Comments are prepended with 'comment' at libpfm level; this does not bode well!
* Reorganize the directories in ga_image
* Try to simplify the algorithm call -> template algorithm call translation
* Merger with rest of project
* Use Size and LargeSize types for image dimensions
* channels() or noChannels()?
* ImageBase* pImage() -> ImageBase& imageT()?
* Assertions -> Exceptions where okay for performance
* Special comment everywhere where all possible formats are listed (so extenders can grep for such places)
* Don't use poor Sch√§uble :(
* ...
* PROFIT!
