This directory contains the directory 'libpfm' and 'pfm_view'. The
directory 'libpfm' contains the C source code of the pfm-library
(pfm.h, pfm.c), the directory 'pfm_view' contains the C++ source code
of a simple Qt-based pfm-viewer.

In order to compile a platform specific version of both, the library
and the viewer, type:

> mkdir x86_64
> cd x86_64
> qmake -spec linux-g++-64 ../pfm.pro
> make

Replace linux-g++-64 with your plattform specific parameter. 

If you want to use the pfm library in other project, copy the header
file pfm.h and the library libpfm.a (both in libpfm) to places, where
your compiler/linker is able to locate them. You can create the library
without Qt's qmake by calling make -f Makefile.orig in the libpfm
directory.
